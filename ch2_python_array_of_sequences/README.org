* An Array of Sequence

** Category of Sequences

*** container vs flat

**** container: can hold items of different types via reference
     
- e.g. list, tuple ...

**** flat: hold items of one type via value

- e.g. str, bytes ... 
  
*** mutable vs immutable

**** mutable: list, deque, ...

**** immutable: tuple, str and bytes
     
** List

- mutable and container
  
*** List Comprehension
    
*** Generator Expression

** Tuple    
   
- immutable list + records with no field names
  
** Slicing

- Why the last item is excluded ? i.e. why [0:2] gives item 0 and 1
  
  Three advantages of excluding the last item
  
  - easy to get the length of the range / slice
    
    - [:3] gives three items

    - [1:2] gives 3 - 1 = 2 items
      
  - easy to split sequence into two parts without overlapping

    - [:x] and [x:]
      
** Multidimensional Slicing
   
- [] taking multiple indexes or slices separated by commas
  
- can use ellipsis to omit some dimensions (?)
